## üìù How to Edit and Generate PDFs

1. **Edit Markdown:**
   - Make changes in the `97_raw_markdown_files/` directory. This mirrors the main folder structure.
   - Do **not** edit PDFs directly; always update the markdown source.

2. **Install Requirements:**
   - Ensure you have Python 3.7+.
   - Install dependencies:
     ```bash
     pip install -r 98_utils/requirements.txt
     ```

3. **Generate PDFs:**
   - Run the batch script from the project root:
     ```bash
     python 98_utils/batch_md_to_pdf.py
     ```
   - This will convert all markdown files (except those in the ignore list) to PDFs, placing them in `98_utils/created_pdfs/` with a mirrored folder structure.

4. **Styling & Assets:**
   - PDFs use `98_utils/md_pdf_style.css` for consistent branding.
   - Logos from `99_visual_assets/` are embedded in the PDFs automatically.

## üí° Usage Examples

### AI & RAG Demonstrations
- **Knowledge Retrieval** - Test document search and retrieval
- **Content Generation** - Generate responses based on company knowledge
- **Document Analysis** - Analyze business processes and procedures

### üï∏Ô∏è Graph RAG Demonstration Setup

This knowledge base is specifically designed to showcase **Graph RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)** capabilities by creating complex, interconnected information that requires relationship navigation.

#### **Why Graph RAG is Superior Here**

Traditional vector-based RAG struggles with questions that require connecting information across multiple documents. This knowledge base demonstrates Graph RAG's ability to:

- **Navigate Entity Relationships** - Connect spacecraft ‚Üí services ‚Üí partnerships ‚Üí personnel
- **Perform Multi-hop Reasoning** - Answer complex questions requiring 3+ document connections
- **Provide Explainable Paths** - Show exactly which documents and relationships led to answers
- **Handle Conditional Logic** - Process "if-then" scenarios across document boundaries

#### **Strategic Information Hiding**

To create realistic Graph RAG challenges, key information has been strategically scattered:

| **Question Type** | **Visible Information** | **Hidden Information Location** | **Graph RAG Challenge** |
|------------------|------------------------|-------------------------------|------------------------|
| **Spacecraft Amenities** | "Swimming Area" (generic) | Voyager specs (3m x 2m zero-g pool) | Connect spacecraft ‚Üí service packages |
| **Luxury Services** | "Gourmet cuisine" (generic) | Partnership docs (Michelin chefs) | Connect partnerships ‚Üí service delivery |
| **Safety Requirements** | Basic training levels | Specific certification requirements | Trace safety protocols across documents |
| **Emergency Procedures** | General response info | Specific team assignments and protocols | Link emergency procedures to spacecraft/missions |

#### **Perfect Graph RAG Demo Questions**

**Complex Multi-hop Questions:**
- *"When flying to the Moon, does the Voyager spacecraft offer zero-gravity swimming pools?"*
  - Requires: Voyager specs + Lunar Luxury Package + Amenity details
  - Graph RAG connects: Spacecraft ‚Üí Mission type ‚Üí Service amenities

- *"What safety training is required for crew operating the Voyager on lunar missions?"*
  - Requires: Voyager specs + Safety certification + Mission requirements + Crew database
  - Graph RAG connects: Spacecraft ‚Üí Mission type ‚Üí Safety requirements ‚Üí Training levels

- *"If there's a medical emergency on the Aurora Explorer, which medical team responds?"*
  - Requires: Aurora specs + Crisis response plan + Medical partnerships + Staff assignments
  - Graph RAG connects: Spacecraft ‚Üí Emergency procedures ‚Üí Medical resources ‚Üí Personnel

**Entity Relationship Questions:**
- *"What luxury services are provided for lunar missions and who are the partners?"*
- *"How much does it cost to operate a lunar mission with the Voyager, including crew salaries?"*
- *"What's the complete customer journey for a Lunar Luxury Package, including all safety requirements?"*

#### **Information Scattering Strategy**

**Documents with Hidden Connections:**
- **Spacecraft Specs** - Technical details but missing service connections
- **Service Packages** - Customer offerings but missing technical specifications  
- **Partnerships** - Business relationships but missing service delivery details
- **Safety Protocols** - Training requirements but missing spacecraft-specific details
- **Employee Database** - Personnel info but missing certification assignments
- **Crisis Response** - Emergency procedures but missing spacecraft-specific protocols

**Why This Demonstrates Graph RAG Value:**
1. **Real-world Complexity** - Information is naturally scattered across departments
2. **Multi-hop Reasoning** - Questions require connecting 3-6 different document types
3. **Entity Relationships** - Clear connections between people, equipment, procedures, and outcomes
4. **Explainable AI** - Can trace reasoning paths for compliance and auditing
5. **Dynamic Updates** - When one element changes, can trace all affected relationships

#### **Graph RAG vs Traditional RAG**

| **Capability** | **Traditional RAG** | **Graph RAG** |
|----------------|-------------------|---------------|
| **Simple Q&A** | ‚úÖ Excellent | ‚úÖ Excellent |
| **Multi-hop Questions** | ‚ùå Struggles | ‚úÖ Excels |
| **Entity Relationships** | ‚ùå Limited | ‚úÖ Strong |
| **Explainable Paths** | ‚ùå Black box | ‚úÖ Clear reasoning |
| **Conditional Logic** | ‚ùå Poor | ‚úÖ Excellent |
| **Complex Dependencies** | ‚ùå Misses connections | ‚úÖ Navigates relationships |

### Business Applications

- **Process Documentation** - Document business workflows
- **Compliance Management** - Maintain regulatory documentation

### Research & Development
- **AI Model Testing** - Evaluate retrieval and generation capabilities
- **Content Analysis** - Study document structure and organization
